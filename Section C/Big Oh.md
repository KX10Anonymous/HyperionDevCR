This code's worst-case space complexity is O. (1). 
The arrays ones and tens are stored in the function using constant space, 
and each call to the recursive function uses a constant amount of extra space. 
For the largest conceivable input value of 1000000000000000, the maximum depth
 of the recursion will never go beyond 15, 
hence the function's overall space consumption is constant.
