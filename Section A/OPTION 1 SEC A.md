1.	There's was a typo in  reverse_string() method. Correct name is reverse_string(), not  reverseString().
2.	Unnecessary to declare a generic type on (T maxNumber) method, the parameter "maxNumber". 
3.	The local variable maxNumber with the same name as parameter was defined, which caused a wrong.
4.	Fibonacci method should have been given a different name instead of "function()", deserved a more descriptive name
5.	In the main() method, the Fibonacci series was being printed outside the function method.
6.	Method function()  used incorrect Fibonacci series code. The for loop's condition was incorrectly updated. However, in the code, the previousNumber was being assigned to the nextNumber instead of being added to the previousNumber to create the new previousNumber.

Overall, the code had minor mistakes and errors. Next time I would encourage the student to use descriptive names when naming functions and to utilise the IDE Format tool to ensure that the code is organised. As the language is java, would also encourage javadoc comments as they allow the student to be able to see function descriptions when calling them.
